# Netzwerk-Bundestag-Online


This piece of code allows you to plot a network with interactive manual selection of possibilities.

The network consists of so-called "Drucksachen (printed matter)" in "Plenarprotokolle (plenary protocols)". 
This allows to see which printed matters were discussed or voted on in which Bundestag debates. 

For this piece of code was used:

networkx, dash, plotly, css
